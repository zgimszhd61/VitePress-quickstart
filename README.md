Here is a quickstart guide for getting started with VitePress:

## Step 1: Install VitePress

First, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-vitepress-site
cd my-vitepress-site
```

Next, initialize a new package.json file:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Then install VitePress as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vitepress
```

You'll also need Vue as a peer dependency if you plan to use Vue components:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vue
```

## Step 2: Create Docs Directory

VitePress uses a `docs` directory to store your markdown files and assets. Create this directory:

```bash
mkdir docs
```

And create an `index.md` file inside it with some starter content:

```markdown
# My VitePress Site

This is the homepage of my new VitePress documentation site!
```

## Step 3: Configure VitePress

Create a `docs/.vitepress/config.js` file to configure your site metadata:

```js
export default {
  title: 'My VitePress Site',
  description: 'Just playing around with VitePress.'
}
```

## Step 4: Start Dev Server

Add some npm scripts to your `package.json` to start the dev server and build for production:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "docs:dev": "vitepress dev docs",
    "docs:build": "vitepress build docs",
    "docs:serve": "vitepress serve docs"
  }
}
```

Then start the dev server:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

This will start a server at `http://localhost:5173` where you can see your VitePress site! [1]

## Step 5: Write More Content

Create additional `.md` files in the `docs` directory. VitePress will automatically pick them up and generate pages based on the file structure. [2]

You can customize the site further by editing the `config.js` file and exploring the many configuration options VitePress provides. [4]

That's the basic quickstart! Refer to the VitePress documentation for more details on theming, deploying, and advanced usage. [1][2][3][4]
